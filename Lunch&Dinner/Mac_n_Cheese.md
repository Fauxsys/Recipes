```
1 cup whole milk
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/2 teaspoon mustard powder
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon cornstarch
8 ounces cream cheese, room temperature, cut into pieces
8 ounces medium cheddar cheese, shredded (about 2½ cups)
8 ounces muenster cheese, shredded (about 2 cups)
3 ounces Fontina cheese, shredded (about 1 cup; optional)
1 pound elbow macaroni
Kosher salt

Simmer milk, cream, mustard powder, and cayenne in a medium pot over medium heat69669*
stirring and being careful not to let mixture boil,
until heated through and well combined, 6–8 minutes.

Mix cornstarch and 2 Tbsp. water in a small bowl to make a slurry, then whisk into milk mixture.
Bring to a boil and cook, whisking constantly, until mixture thickens, 1–2 minutes.
Add cream cheese and cook, whisking occasionally, until mixture is smooth and thick, 2–3 minutes.

Reduce heat to medium-low and gradually stir in cheddar, muenster, and Fontina, if using. Cook, stirring occasionally and reducing heat if mixture starts to boil, until cheeses are almost melted (it’s okay if you see a few shreds of unmelted cheese), 4–6 minutes.

Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Drain and stir into cheese mixture. Gently stir until sauce is smooth and creamy and pasta is evenly coated; taste and season with salt, if needed. Remove from heat; mac and cheese will thicken as it sits. Serve hot.
