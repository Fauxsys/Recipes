- [ ] 3 lbs chicken breasts (boneless, skinless), about 5-6 count
- [ ] 1 1/2 cups BBQ Sauce I used Sweet Baby Rays Honey BBQ
- [ ] 1/2 medium onion grated (with juice)
- [ ] 1 Tbsp olive oil
- [ ] 1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- [ ] 2 Tbsp brown sugar

1. Stir together all sauce ingredients in a 5-6 qt slow cooker.
1. Add chicken and turn to coat. Cover and cook on high 3 to 4 hours or on low for 6-7 hours. Chicken is done when cooked through and easy to shred.
1. Remove chicken to a cutting board and shred each breast using two forks. Place shredded chicken back in the crock pot and stir to coat with the yummy sauce.
