#### [Sauce Poids/Black Bean Sauce](https://cafejohnsonia.com/2013/02/how-to-slow-cooker-black-beans.html)
```
1 lb. black beans, picked over to remove broken or wrinkled beans or small stones
6 cups water
1 onion, halved or diced
2-3 whole garlic cloves
1 bay leaf
1 tablespoon salt (this seems like a lot, but is fine with this much water, you can use less)

1. Wash the beans
1. Place black beans, onion, garlic cloves, and bay leaf in a slow cooker. Add water.
1. Cook on low for 6-8 hours, or high for 3-6 hours. Test the beans at the 3 or 6 hour point.
1. To test doneness, spoon out a few beans and blow on them. If the skins peel back, they beans are ready. Taste just to make sure. If all of the water has been absorbed, add more. Beans must stay completely covered to prevent them from burning.
1. Add the salt and let cook, or sit with heat off for another 20-30 minutes, to absorb the salt. Remove the bay leaf, garlic cloves, and onion before using, if desired.
1. Use immediately, or allow to cool before transferring beans and some of the cooking liquid to a zipper-lock freezer bag or airtight container and refrigerate for up to 1 week, or freeze up to 3 months. If freezing, flatten bag in freezer--it makes for easier defrosting. Defrost in warm water.
